# 1. Streamlining ssh Configuration
First step we need to Show the .ssh/config file
We open the terminal and use the following command
* cd ./.ssh
* ls
The above commands will help us to check that weather exist a config file or not.
If not, we can use another command "touch config" to create a config file.
